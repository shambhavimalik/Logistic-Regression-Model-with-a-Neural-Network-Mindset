# Logistic-Regression-Model-with-a-Neural-Network-Mindset
Aim is to build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This project will step through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset.

**Steps:**
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

Training accuracy is close to 100%. This is a good sanity check: model is working and has high enough capacity to fit the training data. Test accuracy is 68%. It is actually not bad for this simple model, given the small dataset we used and that logistic regression is a linear classifier.
